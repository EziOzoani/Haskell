## Prerequisite

You have installed `stack`.

## Task

1. Open a command-line window and navigate to `CS3016-1718/Exercise01`.
2. Enter `stack test`. 
3. The tests fail. Read the test outcome carefully. 
4. Change the Haskell comment on the first line of `src/Ex01.hs` to refer to your own username and name.
5. Your task is to edit `src/Ex01.hs` to modify it so all tests succeed. You should read all of this file carefully before you start work.
6. To submit, simply upload **only** your revised `Ex01.hs` file to Blackboard.
